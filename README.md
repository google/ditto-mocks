# Ditto
Ditto is a mocking library for the Salesforce platform that helps developers to test 
their code in an environment isolated from the standard libraries of the Salesforce platform.

## Benefits of Using Ditto
- **Test in isolation**: Ditto allows you to test your code without relying on the Salesforce platform's standard libraries, which can help to identify and fix bugs more quickly.
- **Improve test coverage**: Ditto can help you to increase your test coverage by allowing you to mock out specific parts of the Salesforce platform, such as database operations or email distribution.
- **Speed up testing**: Ditto can help to speed up your testing process by eliminating the need to wait for the Salesforce platform to perform certain operations.

## What Can Ditto Do?
Ditto can help developers to mock some of the core parts of the Salesforce platform including:

- Database Operations
- Email Distribution
- Invocable Action Execution
- Flow Interview Invocation
- Test Record Creation
